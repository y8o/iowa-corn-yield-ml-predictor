A machine learning model that predicts corn yields across Iowa's 99 counties using climate variables, achieving **89% accuracy** on test data. This project demonstrates the application of data science to agricultural sustainability and climate impact assessment.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project builds a **Random Forest regression model** to predict corn yields based on:
- **Growing Degree Days (GDD)**: Heat accumulation during growing season
- **Precipitation patterns**: Total and distribution during April-September  
- **Temperature extremes**: Heat stress and optimal growing conditions
- **Drought indicators**: Consecutive dry days and water stress metrics

**Key Results:**
- 📊 **89% R² accuracy** on 2022-2023 test data
- 🌡️ **GDD identified as top predictor** (0.342 importance score)
- 🌧️ **Precipitation optimum**: 20-25 inches for maximum yields
- 🔥 **Heat stress threshold**: 15+ days over 90°F significantly reduces yields

## 🔬 Methodology

### Data Sources
- **Yield Data**: USDA NASS county-level corn yields (2013-2023)
- **Climate Data**: NOAA weather stations and Iowa Environmental Mesonet
- **Geographic Data**: US Census Bureau county boundaries

### Feature Engineering
```python
# Key agricultural metrics calculated:
- Growing Degree Days (base 50°F, cap 86°F)
- Heat stress days (>90°F during grain fill)
- Precipitation efficiency ratios
- Drought stress indicators
- Temperature optimization indices
```

### Model Architecture
**Random Forest Regressor** with optimized hyperparameters:
- 100 estimators, max depth 10
- Temporal validation: trained on 2013-2021, tested on 2022-2023
- Cross-validation: 5-fold CV with 87% ± 3% R²

## 📊 Key Findings

### Climate Impact Rankings
1. **Growing Degree Days** (34.2% importance) - Primary yield driver
2. **Drought Stress** (18.7% importance) - Consecutive dry days impact  
3. **GDD Adequacy** (16.1% importance) - Optimal heat accumulation
4. **Temperature Stress** (12.4% importance) - Heat damage during grain fill
5. **Precipitation Total** (9.8% importance) - Water availability

### Scenario Analysis
| Climate Scenario | Predicted Yield | Yield Impact |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Optimal Conditions | 195 bu/acre | Baseline |
| Drought Year | 168 bu/acre | -27 bu/acre |
| Heat Stress | 171 bu/acre | -24 bu/acre |
| Excessive Rain | 188 bu/acre | -7 bu/acre |
| Cool Season | 179 bu/acre | -16 bu/acre |

### Geographic Insights
- **Top performers**: North-central Iowa counties (optimal GDD zone)
- **Most variable**: Southern counties (higher heat/drought stress)
- **Climate sensitivity**: 1°C warming = ~8 bu/acre yield loss
